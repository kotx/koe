## Note
this repo won't be updated anymore in favor of [Railway starters](https://github.com/railwayapp/starters).

because I use railway instead of fly (for now)

fly config should still work but if you're using railway then use the above repo

---

this is just lavalink

configure `application.yml` if you want.

then you can probably deploy to **fly.io** but first set the `$PORT` and `$PASSWORD` environment variables

for **railway.app** just set `$PASSWORD`.

here's a fancy railway button!
